Notes:-
Using Clean Architecture Structure data and domain and presentation folders.
Using GetX for route management, dependency injection, and state management (for dark and light modes) and make Button in Appbar to toggle between dark and light mode.
Using unit tests to verify the behavior of ThemeService, ensuring it correctly toggles between light and dark themes and persists the theme state.
